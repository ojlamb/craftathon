# Craftathon
The Craftathon is a 1-day event where Makers Academy alumni assemble in teams to solve a problem
given by a real company. For craftathon 3 the pharmacy app company [Serket](http://www.serket.uk/) provided the challenge to enable users to search for pharmacies easily, view useful information and see where they are located on a map.

## Challenge information
Here is an api from Serket, containing pharmacies around England, their name, address, telephone number and NACS code (i.e. FJJ79): http://www.serket.uk/pharmacies/pharmacylist-format

The challenge is to build a single web page that consumes the api and address to the following features as much as possible (the use of external libraries are encouraged):

* A search box that when a person types in some field (i.e. pharmacy name, NACS code, etc) it will produce a list of relevant pharmacies. (Hint: you might want to check datatables.js)
* Upon selecting a pharmacy, the location map will appear on the page.
* Upon selecting a pharmacy, the name, address, postcode, telephone and NACS code will appear on the page.
* To make the UI design of the page user friendly.
